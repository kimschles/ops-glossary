    <h1>Today I Learned</h1>

    <ul>
        <h2><time>10 December 2019</time></h2>
        <li>Using curl for a GET request: <code>curl localhost:8080</code></li>
        <li>Using curl for a POST request where the data is JSON. You add the data, header and -X flag (that means a
            method other than GET is following):
            <code>curl -d '{"greeting":"hello!"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:3001</code></li>
        <h2><time>25 November 2019</time></h2>
        <li>To see data from the metrics-api, run this command: <code>kubectl get --raw "/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq
            </code></li>
        <h2><time>19 November 2019</time></h2>
        <li>You use <code>envFrom: -configMapRef: name: configmap-name</code>to make the key:value pairs in a config map
            environment variables. You use <code>
                env:
                    - name: BACKEND_USERNAME
                      valueFrom:
                        secretKeyRef:
                          name: backend-user
                          key: backend-username
                    - name: DB_USERNAME</code> to convert the data from a k8s secret(s) into environment variables. The
            code goes in the pod manifest.
        </li>
        <h2><time>14 November 2019</time></h2>
        <li>In Kubernetes, the metrics-server collects data about CPU and memory usage for all nodes and pods in a
            cluster. Metrics-server is a deployment. At FW, we deploy metrics-server by installing and upgrading the
            stable Helm chart. The image is hosted in the google container registry. You can see it <a
                href="https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/metrics-server-amd64?gcrImageListsize=30">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Metrics server sends its data to the metrics api, which publishes the data as an api endpoint. The metrics
            api only displays the most current data because there's no mechanism to store and query data from the past.
            That's where a metrics collection tool comes in handy.
        </li>
        <h2><time>13 November 2019</time></h2>
        <li>A Kubernetes volume is a directory that contains files. The files in a volume are available to any container
            in the pod that has a volume, and the files disappear when the pod is deleted, but stay when the pod is
            restarted. The files can be accessed at the <code>volumeMount</code>, which gets a name, and a
            <code>mountPath</code>, which provides a path
            to the directory which contains the files.</li>
        <li>There are different types of Kubernetes volumes. For directories that are on the node, use
            <code>emptyDir</code> or <code>hostPath</code>. For cloud-provider volumes, use
            <code>awsElasticBlockStore</code> or <code>gcePersistentDisk</code>. If you want a distributed file system,
            use <code>cephfs</code>, and there are special types of volumes like <code>secret</code>. Everything I know
            about volumes I learned from <a href="http://kubernetesbyexample.com/volumes/">Kubernetes volumes by
                example</a> </li>
        <h2><time>11 November 2019</time></h2>
        <li> Helm is solving the problem of having to run
            <code>kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code> or <code>kubectl create -f service.yaml</code> over and over
            again
            if you have an
            application with lots of components, or using lots of K8s features like pdbs, hpas, etc. Helm lets you
            install, upgrade, and rollback the app as a deployment. See this drawing for more info (thank you to <a

        <li>In Kubernetes, there are two tools that automate pod scaling: the horizontal pod autoscaler and
            cluster-autoscaler. There is only one K8s-native way to scale notes: cluster-autoscaler.</li>
        <h2><time>28-31 October 2019</time></h2>

        <h3>Luke's Recommended Git Workflow for Open Source golang projects </h3>
        <li>
            - Clone the original project
            - Fork the project and copy the address for the remote
            - Add a second remote called `kim` (you can give this remote your name, or anything else you desire) that
            points to your fork‚Äôs remote
            - Checkout to a new branch and do some work
            - Push your feature to your fork‚Äôs remote (`git push -u kim my_feature` )
            - When you need to merge in new changes from the project, `git pull origin master` and `git rebase
            origin/master`

            <code>

                    git clone git@github.com:fairwindsops/rbac-lookup.git
                    git remote add luke git@github.com:lucasreed/rbac-lookup.git
                    git checkout -b my_feature
                      <Do some work here>
                    git push -u luke my_feature</code>

        <li>LetsEncrypt verifies that you control the domain names you claim via a challenge. The two most common types
            of challenges are <code>HTTP-01</code> (the recommended Let's Encrypt default) and the <code>DNS-01</code>.
            I
            the <code>HTTP-01</code> challenge, Let's Encrypt gives a token to your ACME client, and the ACME client
            puts a file on your webserver that has the token and a print of your account key. Let's Encrypt tries to
            access that file in multiple different ways, and if it gets the response it expects, Let's Encrypt will
            issue a certificate. The <code>DNS-01</code> challenge checks for a TXT record affiliated with the domain
            name. This is what I'm setting up when Firebase asks me to verify my domain. üòÅ A great resource: <a

        <li>In software, the term 'backport' means taking some lines of code from new software, and using it in an older
            version of the same software. This is often done to fix security issues in older software.
        </li>
        <li>Audit logs (AKA an audit trail), are records of a change to a system. In Kubernetes, a way to figure audit
            logs is to record all `GET` `POST` `DELETE` and `PATCHES`, the entity making those requests (a K8s
            controller or a person, etc), and the result of that request. Audit logs are often looked at when examining
            a security breach, or analyzed to uncover trends that could be fixed. Some ways of looking at audit logs are
            Google's Stackdriver, ElasticSearch + Kibana, and Datadog. Audit logs can be _a lot_ of data, so setting up
            limits is likely a cost-saving measure. </li>
        <h2><time>24 September 2019</time></h2>
        <li> A service is a Kubernetes object that has a stable IP address and port, accepts traffic from the internet
            and directs it to a set of pods. A service sits in front of a set of pods, and has a stable IP because pods
            are often killed and recreated with different IP addresses.

            In Kubernetes, there are three types of services:
            (Quoted material is from https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)

            - `clusterIp` (for internal use only)
            > Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from
            within the cluster. This is the default `ServiceType`.
            - `NodePort`
            > Exposes the Service on each Node‚Äôs IP at a static port (the `NodePort`). A `ClusterIP` Service, to which
            the `NodePort` Service routes, is automatically created. You‚Äôll be able to contact the `NodePort` Service,
            from outside the cluster, by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
                    - `LoadBalancer`
                    > Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider‚Äôs load balancer


                    Don‚Äôt use `NodePort` for these reasons:

                    - `NodePort` is bad for network security because you have to allow or disallow all traffic.
                    - `NodePort` port ranges are from `30000-32767`, which is out of range for HTTPS (443), SSH (22) ,
                    and HTTP (80) ports.
                    - If your Node/VM IP addresses change, your `NodePort` address will be broken

                    `NodePort` is useful for demo apps or tutorials, not running things in production.

                    At Fairwinds, we use an ingress controller to accept traffic from the internet, and then route it to
                    the proper service.

        <h2><time>23 September 2019</time></h2>
        <li> In Kubernetes, labels help you organize pods, deployments, services and other Kubernetes Objects. A label
            is a key value pair, and using <code>kubectl</code>,
            you can filter searches by specifying a label. For example,
            <code>k get po -l app=kubernetes-dashboard --all-namespaces</code> will return all pods with the label
            <code>kubernetes-dashboard</code>. If you want to see the labels for all pods, run
            <code>k get po --show-labels --all-namespaces</code>

        <li> CPU Requests and Limits: CPU resources are measured in millicores. A CPU core has 1000 millicores.
            Kubernetes pods can specify the amount of CPU it will request on a node, and they can describe the maximum
            amount of CPU it should be able to use and get throttled if it requests more.
