    <h1>NAT Gateway</h1>
    <p>A NAT (network address translation) Gateway allows computers that
        have private IP addresses to send a receive traffic from the internet. A NAT Gateway acts as a single point of
        entry and exit, and maps private IP addresses
        to a single public address.</p>

    <p>One benefit of a NAT Gateway is that it reduces the number of places an attacker could infiltrate a network. A
        drawback to a NAT Gateway is that if you a getting lots of requests from the internet, the gateway can be a
        bottleneck and slow down response times. </p>

    <p>Each cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) has its own implementation of a NAT Gateway.</p>
