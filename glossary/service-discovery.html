    <h1>Service Discovery</h1>
    <p>When building a distributed system, services need to know the IP address and port of the other services they want
        to talk to. This is tricky for a couple of reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>In the "old system," IP addresses were static. In the new world, IP addresses are dynamic and change
                often. How can services keep track of all the changing IP addresses?</li>
            <li>How does a service know when a new one has come online, or one has been dropped from the network?</li>
        </ol>
        One solution for service discovery is a software that keeps a list of the service name, its health and its IP
        address and port. Hashicorp's Consul uses this solution.
