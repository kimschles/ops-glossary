    <h1>Managed Services</h1>
    <p>In <a href="./cloud-computing.html">cloud computing</a>, managed services are parts of your technology stack like
        databases, message queue systems, log collections, or monitoring dashboards that are hosted and managed by
        another company.</p>
    <p>For example, if you managed your own postgres databases, you would host them on your own servers, you would
        upgrade the software yourself and be responsible for any downtime or issues. If you used the AWS SQL service
        Relational Database Service or RDS, or Google Cloud's CloudSQL, those companies take care of the setup and
        maintenance. </p>
    <p>Think of it like baking bread. You could bake your own bread if you wanted to, and some people enjoy spending the
        time to make a something they love to eat. If you don't want to make your own bread, though, you can buy a loaf
        from a baker or the grocery store and spend your time and energy on something else. Managed services are the
        bread you buy, not bake yourself.</p>
