    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <p>The code, images, and text that create every website we access with our phones or computers are stored on a
        computer called a server. Cloud computing is when we rent those servers instead of purchasing, setting up and
        taking care of
        those computers ourselves.</p>
    <p>One benefit of cloud computing is that a company like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft
        (these companies are called cloud providers)
        will take care of the the physical computers, make sure they are safe, and replace them when they stop working.
    </p>
    <p>Another benefit of cloud computing is that the cloud provider will install the operating system, and upgrade
        software, including software patches that improve security.
    </p>
    <p>When someone else manages a datacenter and the software on these servers, it allows your company or agency to
        focus on building a product that works for your customers.</p>
